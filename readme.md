This is probably the SIMPLEST Pricing Tables plugin you'll ever use. All you need to do is type a group (2-5) of pricing options in `<ol>` ordered lists within the shortcode tags. That's it!

##Description

I've wanted to add SIMPLE Pricing Tables to my website for a while but many of the plugins I tried out were either Freemium (requiring me to purchase the full version in order to unlock the full functionality) or more complicated than I actually wanted.

THIS plugin is exceptionally simple. 
1. Step 1: Type the shortcode tags `[jkl-pricing-table] ... [/jkl-pricing-table]`
2. Step 2: Add an `<ol>` ordered list for your Pricing Table
3. Step 3: Tweak until it looks right

Requires WordPress 3.5 and PHP 5.

###Special Features
* Styled like Zurb Foundation 5 Pricing Tables
* Utilizes CSS3 for interesting transition effects (like scaling)

###How To Use the Plugin 
1. Type the shortcode tags
2. Create an ordered list `<ol>` within the tags
3. Type the heading for your first table in the first `<ol>` item and hit return
4. TAB the `<ol>` in to add the remainder of your content for the first table
5. Un-indent the `<ol>` to write the heading of your second table
6. TAB in for the remainder of the content in your second table
7. Rinse, repeat for multiple tables (supports up to 5 in a row)

###Planned Upcoming Features
* Use jQuery to support more tables in one row
* Make responsively beautiful

###Translations
* English (EN) - default
* Korean (KO) - upcoming

If you want to help translate the plugin into your language, please have a look at the `.pot` file which contains all definitions and may be used with a [gettext] editor.

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, you can send your [gettext .po or .mo file] to me so that I can bundle it in the plugin.
