This is probably the SIMPLEST Pricing Tables plugin you'll ever use. Just type an
ordered list of ordered lists within the shortcode tags.

== Description ==

I've wanted to add SIMPLE Pricing Tables to my website for a while but many of the 
plugins I tried out were either Freemium (requiring me to purchase the full version
in order to unlock the full functionality) or more complicated than I actually wanted.

THIS plugin is exceptionally simple. 
1. Step 1: Type the shortcode tags `[jkl-pricing-table] ... [/jkl-pricing-table]`
1. Step 2: Add an `<ol>` ordered list for your Pricing Table
1. Step 3: Tweak until it looks right

Requires WordPress 3.5 and PHP 5.

= Special Features = 
* Styled like Zurb Foundation 5 Pricing Tables
* Utilizes CSS3 for interesting transition effects (like scaling)

= How To Use the Plugin = 
1. Type the shortcode tags
1. Create an ordered list `<ol>` within the tags
1. Type the heading for your first table in the first `<ol>` item and hit return
1. TAB the `<ol>` in to add the remainder of your content for the first table
1. Un-indent the `<ol>` to write the heading of your second table
1. TAB in for the remainder of the content in your second table
1. Rinse, repeat for multiple tables (supports up to 5 in a row)

= Planned Upcoming Features = 
* Use jQuery to support more tables in one row
* Make responsively beautiful

= Translations = 
* English (EN) - default
* Korean (KO) - upcoming

If you want to help translate the plugin into your language, please have a look 
at the `.pot` file which contains all definitions and may be used with a [gettext] 
editor.

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, 
you can send your [gettext .po or .mo file] to me so that I can bundle it in the
plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Tips =
As a general rule, it is always best to keep your WordPress installation and all 
Themes and Plugins fully updated in order to avoid problems with this or any other 
Themes or Plugins. I regularly update my site and test my Plugins and Themes with
the latest version of WordPress.

= How can I change the style of the plugin to match my website? =
Each element contains its own unique CSS identifier under `.pricing-tables`, allowing 
you to hook into those in your own Custom CSS stylesheet.

= How can I add more tables? =
Simply add another `<ol>` item.

= Why aren't the table items the same size? =
Try to keep the content of each of your `<li>` elements to approximately the same
length in order to keep the size of the pricing tables consistent. i.e. if one of
your `<li>` elements is 2 lines long, try to make EVERY table at the same `<li>` 
element also be 2 lines long. (See some examples at my documentation site - upcoming).
